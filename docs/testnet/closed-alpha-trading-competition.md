```
Eligibility Requirements:
1. All users who have been accepted into the closed alpha are automatically eligible to participate. No opt-in is required.

2. To immediately begin having PnL qualify for rewards, users must meet the following conditions before competition start time:
    - Have 10,000 USDP or LESS in their account
    - If you have more than 10,000 USDP in your account, please withdraw such
      that your account balance is below 10,000. [note to self, we will allow
      up to 10000.1 in case users miss dust amounts and get dq’ed.]
    - Have NO open positions

3. All trading activity within the competition period will count towards scoring. "Late entries" (e.g. users newly admitted to the closed alpha mid-competition) are immediately eligible, provided they meet the balance requirement.
    - when an account satisfies the requirement of the conditions at 
      competition start, their account starts being tracked by the
      competition leaderboard.

[](#scoring-metrics)

Scoring Metrics:

*   The Week 1 competition will reward users purely on their absolute USDP PnL.
    
*   PnL = ending\_account\_equity - beginning\_account\_equity - deposits\_during\_period + withdrawals\_during\_period.
    

Please note that this is calculated as USDP PnL, not % ROI. **Therefore it is strongly encouraged that each user starts with a full 10,000 USDP balance.** If you currently have <10,000 USDP, please mint additional test funds, or ask the team to send some to you.
