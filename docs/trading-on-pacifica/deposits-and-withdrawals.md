Before trading, you’ll need a compatible DeFi wallet with a Solana address connected to Pacifica, and USDC collateral to fund your trades.

Pacifica supports multiple wallet types, including Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, Ledger (via browser extension), and other WalletConnect-compatible wallets.

Withdrawals

**IMPORTANT:** Pacifica currently limits single account withdrawals up to a maximum of $100,000 every 24 hours for security purposes as we scale up Closed Beta. Any additional deposits will be gated from the frontend, and API deposits over these amounts will be in held in pending.

Unrealised PnL can be withdrawn from isolated positions or cross-margined account account. Please see [Margin & Leverage](https://docs.pacifica.fi/trading-on-pacifica/margin-and-leverage) for full details. Pacifica also enforces a time-based global withdrawal cap as a risk-mitigation mechanism that scales dynamically with withdrawal limits. This is extremely unlikely to interfere with normal user withdrawals.
